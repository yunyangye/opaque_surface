   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Node Connection Errors
   ************* ..Node connection errors are often caused by spelling mistakes in a node name field.
   ************* ..To track down the problem, search the idf file for each node name listed to see if it
   ************* ..occurs in the expected input fields.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
